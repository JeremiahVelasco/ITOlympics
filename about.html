                    FEU Diliman's history unfolds uniquely among FEU schools, beginning in 1983 when it was established as the Institute of Technology on a sprawling 10-hectare property in Quezon City. Originally offering engineering programs, it eventually transitioned back to the main campus in Manila. In 1994, it was reborn as the Nicanor Reyes Educational Foundation (FEU-FERN College), commemorating Dr. Nicanor Reyes Sr.'s centennial. The institution evolved, gaining recognition for programs in Accountancy, Business, IT, and Basic Education. Notable achievements include UAAP championships in football and chess, leading to state-of-the-art sports facilities. Recent years focus on character and competence development, striving for a unique learning experience. For Basic Education, the emphasis is on advanced curriculum, values formation, and holistic development. In Tertiary Education, FEU Diliman aims to be a hub for Business and IT fusion, producing technology-empowered professionals. Aligning under the FEU Institute of Technology in 2018-2019, it pursued PAASCU accreditation and Autonomous Status. After 25 years, FEU Diliman remains committed to shaping principled leaders and successful citizens.
